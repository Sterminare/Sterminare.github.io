              <p style="float:right"><img src="\hardware\images\carry.jpg" alt="Carry Cover Photo" width=50% style="float:left; padding:10px" padding="10px">Carry was the robot that our team built for the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition. This year, I was the team Captain and lead mechanic, and was going to drive in the competition. The challenge for this year was to pick up yellow gator balls, called 'power cells', and then transport and deposit them across the field. Additionally, we had to spin a color wheel to a specific color, then climb the tilting balance beam in the center of the field.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the competition was cancelled just weeks before we were set to compete. It was especially dissapointing because of how well the robot was turning out. It wasn't a waste of time, though, because building the robot was half the fun of the competition and we all learned a lot anyway.</p>

              <h2>The Intake - 3D Printed</h2>   
              <p style="float:right; text-indent:50px each-line"><img src="\hardware\images\carry_gif_0.gif" alt="Carry Intake" width=60% style="float:left; padding:10px" padding="10px">The intake was pneumatically deployed and retracted. It had a motorized axle at the front, which had 3D printed vector wheels. The special wheels would drag the balls sideways towards the center, making them easy to catch. Then the rubber wheels at the center brought the power cells into the robot where they could be stored until they needed to be deposited at the goal.</p>

              <p style="float:right"><img src="\hardware\images\carry_gif_3.gif" width=30% style="float:left; padding:10px">To rotate the color wheel, Carry had a soft foam wheel that was deployed vertically by a pneumatic cylinder. We would deploy, then drive into the wheel, then rev up the motor to spin the color wheel.</p>

              <p>Carry was going to be able to climb on the balance beam by lifting up the 'BIG BOY'- a powerful winch hook, hooking onto the beam, then retracting the winch to pull itself up.</p>
