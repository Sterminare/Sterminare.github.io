              <p style="float:right">Goddard is a robot dog that I designed in Fusion 360, 3D printed on my homebuilt printers, and am currently programming myself. It is about 18in long and weighs about 6lbs. It runs on an Arduino Uno.</p>

              <h2>The CAD</h2>   
              <p style="float:right; text-indent:50px each-line"><img src="\hardware\images\f1d0_0.png" alt="Goddard CAD" width=50% style="float:left; padding:10px" padding="10px">To design Goddard, I used Fusion 360 because it is very powerful and I am competent at using it. I knew that with the relatively small servos that I was going to use, I couldn't make it too large. However I also made sure to make it big enough to house all the necessary electronics. Overall I am happy with the dimensions, it is about the same size as my cat.<br /><br />A key design decision was to make sure that the servos were not at all structural and only serve to move the joints. This protects the servos from damage from physical shocks, like the feet repeatedly stepping on the ground. That is why each of the three axes of rotation are supported on both sides by 608zz bearings.<br /><br />       Additionally, to increase the speed at which the legs can swing, the servo that controls the 'knee' is high up on the leg, connected to the foreleg by a parallel linkage. This keeps the mass of the foreleg very low, so it can be driven quickly which will increase the speed of the gait.</p>

              <img src="\hardware\images\f1d0_5.jpg" alt="Goddard Sitting" width=100%>
              <p>Goddard's legs have three degrees of movement each: They can swing forward and backward at the knee and at the hip, and also swing in and out at the hip. This allows it to turn in place, and tilt its body.</p>
              <img src="\hardware\images\f1d0_3.jpg" alt="Early Prototype" width=100%>
              <p>This is an early prototype of Goddard. The white material was less expensive so I made first prototypes out of it, because they would need to be reprinted anyway.</p>
