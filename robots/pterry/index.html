              Pterry was the robot that our team, 6422 the Gearheadz, built for the 2019 FIRST Robotics Competition. This year I was the lead mechanic. The goal of this year's game was to pick up orange kick balls, called cargo, and acrylic disks called hatch panels. Then, place the panels on the cargo ship or rocket, and fill it with cargo.   <img src="\hardware\images\pterry_gif_1.gif" alt="Pterry" width=50% style="padding:10px"> Above, Pterry places a hatch panel on the middle stage of the rocket. (Pterry has the red bumpers that say "6422", and the two giant googly eyes.)</p>

On the robot, it was lifted up and down by the elevator. It was very important, because it would pick up and dispense the cargo, and also had deployable suction cups to score hatch panels. <br /><br />To pick up the cargo, which were rolling around on the floor, we had flexible vinyl tubing attached to an axle that would spin very quickly. When we drove near a cargo, they would get sucked into the box, where rigid wheels would pull it through to hold it and then dispense it out the back.<br /><br />To score hatch panels, we had deployable suction cups. They were on either side of the box, and were spring loaded and retrated with a winch system. We used pneumatics to make the suction cups grab the smooth acrylic hatch panel, and then released it when they were in place on the goal.</p>
